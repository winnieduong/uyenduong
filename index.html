                <p>I came to the University of Cincinnati with two passions that have shaped who I am today: a love for technology and a deep curiosity about how people learn. Before arriving at UC, I spent time working in education, where I saw how powerful the right tools and environments can be in helping people grow. That experience taught me that learning is not just about information, but about curiosity, confidence, and connection. It also showed me that technology has the potential to either widen or close the gap in access to opportunity, depending on how it is designed.</p>

   		<div class="col-six tab-full">
				<p>As an Information Technology major with a Computer Science minor, I am interested in building systems that are not only efficient, but also thoughtful and human centered. I am especially drawn to areas such as artificial intelligence, data driven systems, and software engineering, because they sit at the center of many of the challenges and possibilities facing our world today.<br><br>Through the University Honors Program, I hope to explore these interests in a deeper and more interdisciplinary way. I want to challenge myself through research, collaboration, and creative problem solving while learning how to connect technical work to real human needs. My goal is to leave UC not just as a stronger engineer, but as a more reflective and responsible innovator.</p>

			<h2>Year 2: 2024-2025</h2>
			<p>This past year marked an important turning point in my time at the University of Cincinnati. As a second year student in Information Technology with a Computer Science minor, I entered the year with a clear goal of securing a co-op position that would allow me to apply what I was learning in the classroom to real world practice. When I quickly realized how competitive and unstable the technology job market had become, I was forced to rethink what professional growth would look like for me in this stage of my journey. While that realization was difficult, it ultimately pushed me toward some of the most meaningful learning experiences I have had so far.<br>
			One of the most impactful experiences this year was confronting rejection and uncertainty in the co-op search process. Submitting applications, preparing for interviews, and not receiving offers was emotionally challenging, especially when I was putting in so much effort. However, this experience taught me something essential about resilience and adaptability. Rather than allowing the lack of a co-op to define my progress, I began to focus on what I could control. That shift led me to invest more deeply in personal projects, skill building, and collaborative opportunities that would strengthen both my technical abilities and my confidence.<br>
			Working on personal projects became a major source of growth this year. Without the structure of a formal internship, I took ownership of my learning by designing and building software that reflected my interests in technology and problem solving. These projects pushed me to learn new frameworks, debug complex issues, and think critically about how users interact with systems. More importantly, they gave me something concrete to show for my work, helping me build a stronger portfolio and a clearer sense of what kind of technologist I want to become.<br>
			Another defining experience was participating in hackathons. These fast paced, team based environments challenged me in ways that traditional coursework does not. I learned how to collaborate under pressure, communicate technical ideas, and transform abstract concepts into working solutions within a short time. Hackathons also helped me see myself as part of a broader tech community. They showed me that I do not need to wait for permission or a formal role to contribute, create, and innovate.<br>
			Looking ahead, I plan to continue using these experiences as a foundation for my growth. Academically, my goal is to deepen my understanding of software engineering, data systems, and artificial intelligence through advanced coursework and independent study. Professionally, I want to continue expanding my project portfolio with applications that demonstrate both technical skill and real world relevance. I also plan to participate in more hackathons, research opportunities, and collaborative tech initiatives through UC.<br>
			While the job market may remain uncertain, this year taught me that my trajectory does not depend on one opportunity alone. By staying proactive, building tangible skills, and engaging with meaningful experiences, I am creating my own path forward. My goal for the coming year is not just to secure a co op, but to continue becoming a confident, capable, and adaptable engineer who is ready for whatever challenges come next.</p>
 
			<h2>Year 1: 2023-2024</h2>
			<p>This year was not simply my first year at the University of Cincinnati. It was my first year learning how to belong in a new country, a new academic culture, and a new version of myself. Coming from Vietnam, I arrived with excitement, but also with the quiet weight of being far from everything familiar. I had to learn how to navigate not only classes and assignments, but also conversations, expectations, and social norms that I had never encountered before. Every day required small acts of courage, from speaking up in class to making new friends to asking for help when I did not fully understand something.<br>
			One of the biggest ways I grew this year was learning to be comfortable with discomfort. In my early weeks at UC, I often felt invisible or unsure of where I fit. I was surrounded by talented students who seemed confident in their voices, while I was still translating my thoughts across languages and cultures. Instead of withdrawing, I made a deliberate choice to keep showing up. I joined discussions even when my words were not perfect. I reached out to classmates even when I feared rejection. Over time, those small risks built into something stronger: a sense of belonging that came not from fitting in, but from allowing myself to be seen.<br>
			Resilience, for me, did not look like pushing through everything alone. It meant learning when to pause, when to reflect, and when to ask for support. There were moments this year when academic pressure and homesickness collided, and I felt overwhelmed. During those times, I leaned on campus resources and the people around me. Honors advisors, professors, and peer mentors became anchors who reminded me that struggling did not mean failing. It meant learning. By using tutoring, office hours, and academic coaching, I began to approach challenges with curiosity instead of fear.<br>
			I also rebuilt resilience by reconnecting with my own motivations. Whenever I felt discouraged, I returned to why I came here in the first place: to grow, to learn, and to become someone capable of contributing meaningfully to the world. Keeping a journal, setting small goals, and reflecting on my progress helped me recognize that growth is not always visible in big achievements. Often, it shows up in quieter moments, such as having the confidence to ask a question or the patience to persist through uncertainty.<br>
			As I look ahead, I want to continue building on this foundation of resilience and self awareness. I plan to stay connected to the University Honors Program, academic advisors, and student organizations that give me a sense of community. I also intend to be more intentional about checking in with mentors and using feedback as a tool for growth rather than a source of anxiety. Most importantly, I will keep holding myself accountable by reflecting regularly on my goals and reminding myself that progress is a process.<br>
			This year taught me that resilience is not about never struggling. It is about learning how to move forward with purpose, support, and belief in your own capacity to grow.</p>
